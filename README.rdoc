= SSL Install Tool
== What
The SSL gem automates creation, validation and installation of ssl certificates on the server. It detects the
web sites on the server and creates and sends the certificate requests to an globally trusted certificate authority.
Optionally, it does the validation and installation of the signed certificate so that minimal manual
work needs to be involved.
== Installing
  gem install ssl
