= SSL Install Tool

== Synopsis
SSL is oftentimes diffucult and/or tedious to install, but it doesn't need to be.
The SSL gem automates creation, validation and installation of ssl certificates on the server. It detects the
web sites on the server and creates and sends the certificate requests to an globally trusted certificate authority.
Optionally, it does the validation and installation of the signed certificate so that minimal manual
work needs to be involved.

== Examples
Use this command to initialize ssl on your server installation
  ssl create

Other examples:
  ssl create --cert_domains www.domain.com
  ssl install --cert_number 1

== Install
  gem install ssl
== Usage
ssl COMMAND [options]
